Linux Servers:

- Nat Gateway:
-- Gotta disable source/dest checking on the instance
-- Enable ip_forwarding
-- iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
-- No security groups. Because we hate security! :-)

- Firewalld router:
-- In AWS:
--- Create three ENIs. 2 in the public subnet, one in the private subnet.
--- Then create two EIPs and associate them with the public subnet ENIs.
--- Create a t2.medium (so it can have 3 ips) and attach the three interfaces.
--- TURN OFF SOURCE/DEST CHECK ON ALL INTERFACES
-- On the host:
--- set ip forwarding. Probably should do it with sysctl so it sticks
--- Disable rp_filter! :-)
--- set gateway in /etc/sysconfig/network
--- create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX files
--- install firewalld

- Old Joomla: This box will have ALL THE SERVICES. It's an old admin's experiment and should die (via inject). Just gotta keep the compliance links.
